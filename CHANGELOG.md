# 9.0.0 (2016-09-SOON)

- **Node 6 support!** We've been blocked on supporting node 6.x for quite a
  while now ([issue/176]), but thanks to some upstream work
  ([here](https://github.com/atom/first-mate/pull/74) and
  [here](https://github.com/atom/highlights/pull/44)), the blocker has been
  removed, and now you can use marky in The Futureâ„¢. ([pull/227] by
  [ashleygwilliams])
- **Node 0.10/0.12 dev environment no longer supported** We've updated our
  devDependency on JS Standard to 8.x which no longer support Node 0.10 and 0.12.
  Node 0.10 and Node 0.12 are being EOLd this year, and as a result, we feel
  ok no longer supporting them as development environments. You can still **use**
  marky using 0.10 or 0.12, but if you want to develop it, you'll need to upgrade
  to Node 4 or later. ([pull/239] by Greenkeeper)
- **More GitHub-like heading rendering!** Working out a solution for [issue/224]
  led us down a path that resulted in our generated headings getting closer to
  what GitHub renders. Now the `deep-link` class and generated `id` slugs that
  we formerly applied to heading elements themselves are added to a link we put
  inside the heading. This means we no longer wrap headings' entire contents in
  a link, which means we can generate an anchor for every heading, not just ones
  that don't contain links to begin with. Win! (also, Mouthful!). The new-style
  links contain an SVG icon that matches GitHub's hover icon; if you want to
  disable it, you can pass `{enableHeadingLinkIcons: false}` in marky's
  `options`. Big thanks to [nwhetsell] for the help! ([pull/225] by
  [ashleygwilliams] and [revin])
- **More GitHub-like link/image/paragraph rendering!** Oops, we were stripping
  out `title` attributes from links and images, as well as `align` attributes
  from paragraphs during the rendering process, but now we handle those
  correctly, so, e.g., `[link](#url "title text")` turns into
  `<a href="#url" title="title text">link</a>` like it should, and if you have
  inline HTML like `<p align="center">...</p>` the alignment doesn't get
  stripped. ([pull/235], [issue/241] by [kasbah], [pull/242])
- **Even _more_ GitHub-like heading rendering!** [kasbah] clued us into the fact
  that GitHub only considers `# header` text to be a header if there's no
  leading whitespace before the `#` character (CommonMark allows up to three
  leading spaces, see the [specification](http://spec.commonmark.org/0.26/#example-38)).
  Thanks, [kasbah]! ([issue/233], [pull/234])
- **Leaner published package!** We used to ship marky with the unit test suite
  included, but now it's in our [npm ignore] file, so `npm install` no longer
  gives you the tests. They're still here, of course; you just have to clone the
  repo now :smile: ([pull/223] by [ashleygwilliams])

#### CommonMark 0.26

The specification that forms the basis for "standard" Markdown parsing continues
to evolve; it's up to [0.26](http://spec.commonmark.org/0.26/) now, with the
changes implemented in [markdown-it 8.0.0]. The main updates are:

  - When whitespace is used to specify a block (for example, the indentation
    that creates a code block, or indenting lists), it's now legal to use tab
    characters rather than spaces. Such leading tabs now behave as if they were
    replaced by four spaces.
  - Ordered lists that appear at the end of paragraphs are required to start
    with a 1.
  - It's now legal to have multiple blank lines between list items. CommonMark
    used to treat those as separate lists, but now they collapse into the same
    list (which is nice for us, because that's how GitHub has always done it).
  - Text emphasis is calculated differently now. `*foo**bar**baz*` used to be
    `<em>foo</em><em>bar</em><em>baz</em>` but now it becomes
    `<em>foo</em><strong>bar</strong><em>baz</em>`.

### Dependencies

- `markdown-it` updated to `8.0.0`
- `highlights` updated to `1.4.0`
- `cheerio` updated to `0.22.0`

# 8.1.0 (2016-08-08)

### New Features

- Browserify- now easier than before! Following up on [wmhilton]'s
  work from our `8.0.0` release, [zeke] added some scripts and docs
  to make using marky with Browserify even easier. Among other things,
  marky now ships with a browserified file ready to go! ([pull/211])

### Bug Fixes

- Table troubles be gone! Or at least, any troubles with text-alignment.
  Marky was stripping `style` attributes from `<td>` and `<th>` elements-
  and thanks to [revin]'s hardwork, it isn't anymore! 
  ([issues/212], [pull/216])

### Docs

- A slightly new and reogranized README- refocused to make it easier for
  potential users of marky to learn about what marky does and wants to do!
  ([pull/221])

### Dependencies

- `mocha` updated to `3.0.2` ([pull/219])
- `atom-language-nginx` update to `0.6.1`, adding support for highlighting
  [lua directives]! ([pull/214])

# 8.0.0 (2016-07-08)

Progress toward feature parity with GitHub's markdown rendering continues...

### New Features / Breaking Changes

- get your `class` on: syntax highlighting now supports ES2015 ([pull/206])!
  The changes to the rendered markup for highlighted JavaScript
  aren't purely additive (we wish we could be more specific, but the
  functionality comes from [atom/language-javascript], which currently
  doesn't publish a changelog; if you're feeling particularly brave,
  there's always the [diff](https://github.com/atom/language-javascript/compare/b47a7fe...5fb7053)
  :flushed:), so dependening on how your CSS works, there may or may
  not be non-trivial work for you to do
- changed the way certain links are auto-generated (i.e., linkifying
  `www.example.com` but not `readme.md`) so as to more closely match
  how Github does it ([pull/151], [issue/146]); thanks to [puzrin]
  for help working out the details
- `<` and `>` are no longer allowed in auto-linked text due to a
  sub-dependency update coming in from `markdown-it` (see below, also
  [linkify-it/26] for details)
- we now allow [link reference definitions] to appear immediately
  following paragraphs rather than requiring a blank link in between
  them; this contradicts
  [CommonMark](http://spec.commonmark.org/0.25/#example-175) but
  matches Github's behavior. ([issue/159], [pull/164])
- we now support Github flavored markdown [task lists] in markdown
  documents. ([issue/166], [pull/168])
- we no longer strip HTML `<dl>`, `<dt>`, and `<dd>` elements from
  embedded markup, so you can write definition lists. HOWEVER: these
  are not directly supported by any particular standard Markdown
  syntax; since they are treated as inline HTML, any lines indented
  with four or more spaces will get rendered as code blocks as per
  CommonMark; see the discussion in [issue/169]. ([pull/170])
- big thanks to [wmhilton] who swooped in out of the blue and made
  it so **marky now works in a web browser!** :tada: :tada: :tada:
  Unfortunately, you have to specify `{highlightSyntax: false}` in
  the options because the deepest recesses of our dependency tree
  have some native C++ stuff which can't be browserified. On the
  other hand, leaving out syntax highlighting cuts the final bundle
  size roughly in half, so that's a win. ([pull/203])
- if you invoke marky with `{highlightSyntax: false}` in the options,
  we no longer apply the syntax highlighting-related CSS classes to
  the rendered HTML; e.g., rather than
  `<div class="highlight js"><pre class="editor editor-colors">...</pre></div>`
  we will render simply `<pre><code>...</code></pre>`. ([issue/162],
  [pull/163])


#### CommonMark 0.25

Due to the update to `markdown-it` (see below), our markdown parsing now uses CommonMark 0.25 (up from 0.23) as a baseline. The [CommonMark 0.24 Changelog] and [CommonMark 0.25 Changelog] have the details; the main interesting parts are:

  - setext headings can span multiple lines now

    ```
    This didn't work as a heading before
    but now it does
    =========
    ```

  - link destinations can no longer contain spaces, even when surrounded by angle brackets

    ```
    [link text](<this used to be valid.html>)
    ```

    *Note:* This has already caught a few people out; we have an issue tracking it (see [issue/195]) and are looking at reintroducing the more flexible (non-standard) parsing in the future.

  - valid link schemes used to be enumerated ('http', 'https', 'ftp', etc...); now they're defined as "any sequence	of 2--32 characters beginning with an ASCII letter and followed by any combination of ASCII letters, digits, or the symbols plus ('+'), period ('.'), or hyphen ('-')"; in practice, this won't affect most documents, but it *is* more flexible and future-compatible.

# 7.0.1 (2016-05-28)

- removed some unused configuration option handling from the process
  by which we wrap markdown code blocks ([pull/154])

### Tests

- unit tests were breaking when dependencies's READMEs weren't in
  our file tree (specifically mocha, a devDependency); now we skip
  trying to process those ([pull/184])
- a dependency was leaking a variable into the global scope; now we
  test for that; thanks [aredridel]! ([issue/180], [pull/186])
- added some tests to make sure marky doesn't accidentally do
  mustache template variable replacement ([issue/160], [pull/161])


### Dependencies

- `glob` updated to `7.0.0` ([pull/150])
- `lodash.pickBy` updated to `4.2.1` ([pull/155])

# 7.0.0 (2016-02-08)

### Breaking Changes

- updated `markdown-it` to `5.1.0` that broke the behavior of
  fenced code blocks. updated tests to reflect new behavior.
  ([pull/100]) by [revin]
- we were seeing rendering issues because `markdown-it` does not
  do anything with tab characters in fenced code blocks. we now
  convert tab characters into four-spaces, which follows Github
  flavored markdown ([issue/126],[pull/127]) by [revin]
- converts emoji in heading IDs to emoji shortcode names to more
  closely match Github flavored markdown ([issue/128], [pull/133])

# 6.0.4 (2016-02-08)

### Documentation

- badges about the time til close for PRs and issues were added to
  the `README` by [ashleygwilliams]
- a line about `:emoji:` conversion was added to the `README` by
  [revin]
- a trailing comma in the options description was removed by [revin]

### Tests

- originally we were installing some packages as `devDependencies` in 
  order to use their `README`s in tests. this became an issue when
  greenkeeper would attempt to update them and break our tests :) 
  we now have pulled in the `README`s as static assets ([issue/91]
  [pull/114]), by [revin]
- tests were all in a single file, broken up in categories
  ([issue/122], [pull/123]) by [revin]
- test coverage was greatly improved ([pull/138]) by [revin]
  - our `packagize` module would error out if the package provided,
    lacked a name, `if()` guard added
  - ensure that `cdn` module bails if there isn't sufficient package
    data supplied
  - add a few lines to  `github.md` test fixture to make sure it
    handles `<img>` elements with a blank/missing `src` attribute
    and `<a>` elements with a blank/missing `href`
  - ensure running marky with `{debug: true}` produces the same output
    as normal execution

# 6.0.3 (2016-01-14)

### Bug Fix

- we strip `h1` tags from `README`s that have the same content as the
  package name, however we did not update this feature to account for
  scoped package names, e.g. @scope/pkg. now we remove the scope from
  the package meta-data to check the `README`'s `h1`. 
  ([issue/48][pull/103]) - reported by [sindresorhus], solved by [revin]

  disabled shortcut emoji parsing in the markdown-it-emoji plugin. 
  ([issue/95], [pull/97]) - reported by [cloakedninjas], solved by [revin]

# 6.0.1 (2016-01-07)

### Bug Fix

- `markdown-it@5.1.0` would break the build, so `package.json` was updated
  to hold at minor version, `~5.0.2` ([pull/90][pull/93]) - by [ashleygwilliams]
